This is a tool for calculating RSA values.

Use:
- Simple run the script like: python2.7 rsa_calc.py

Troubleshooting:
- This was made as a 'quick and dirty' tool, and will produce errros when the inputs are not in the correct format, as no typcasting is used
- This only works with python2.7

> Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
