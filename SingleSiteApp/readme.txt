This is A dedicated web interface display application.

This is designed to be a direct interface to your SOC web interfaces, and not as a fully functioning web browser.

Setup:
- Change the IP address part of the 'browser.load' call in the main python file to the IP or domain you wish to display.
- Then run the script like: python3.7 SingleSiteApp.py

Troubleshooting:
- This application currently does not support CSS or HTML5, or any dynamic content web plugins such as flash.
